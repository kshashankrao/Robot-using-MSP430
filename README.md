# Robot-using-MSP430
Aim: To build a MSP430 and Infrared controlled obstacle avoiding Robot

The developed robot will move in a whirpool path until a object is detected by IR sensor. If detected, the robot stops. The hardware includes MSP430 microcontroller, IR sensor and SAMBOT(robot chasis equipped with stepper motor). It was programmed using embedded C compiled with CCS studio.
